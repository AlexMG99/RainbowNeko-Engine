### Frustum

## User Interface Sub-system
We have implemented a main menu that contains a fullscreen background image. 
As a child of the canvas we have an **Input Box** which request the testers name and a **Start Button** which can be pressed with the mouse or the keyboard.

As soon as the **Start Button** is pressed the fullscreen background and all that it contain fades away and show an 3D scene.
When the new scene is loaded pressing the button **F1** the teaster can open an options window. In it the teaster will find a **Check Box** which allow to activate or deactivate vsync.
